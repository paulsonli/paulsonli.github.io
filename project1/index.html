      <h1>Iceland</h1>

      <p><span>Iceland</span> is a country of sharp contrast. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

          <p>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddes of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From the September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow. <br> The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.</p>
